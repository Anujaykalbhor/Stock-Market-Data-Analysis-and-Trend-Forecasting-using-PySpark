# Tata Motors Stock Price Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of Tata Motors' historical stock price data. The analysis is performed using Python and leverages popular libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is to explore trends, patterns, and insights from the provided historical stock price data of Tata Motors. The analysis is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes the code, explanations, and visualizations. A Python script is also provided for direct execution.

### Files in this Repository:

- `Tata_motors_analysis_project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, including data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and any predictive modeling.
- `Tata_motors_analysis_project.py`: A Python script version of the notebook's code, useful for running the analysis directly.
- `TATAMOTORS.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis, containing historical stock price data for Tata Motors.

    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` and `YourRepositoryName` with your actual GitHub details.)

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    You'll need to install the necessary Python libraries. A common way to do this is using `pip`. You might need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the libraries used (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

3.  **Run the analysis:**
    You can either open the Jupyter Notebook to follow the step-by-step analysis or run the Python script.
    - To open the notebook: `jupyter notebook`
    - To run the script: `python Tata_motors_analysis_project.py`
